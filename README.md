3. Run `expo start` to see and trigger the different options ( ios/android on a real device/emulator ).

****Notes****

 * In case you are working with a real device make sure you are on the same wifi as your pc/mac.
 * In case you wish to run on an ios emulator you'll have to download xcode from appstore.
 * In package.json you can find some other direct scripts.
